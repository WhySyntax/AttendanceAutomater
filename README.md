# AttendanceAutomater
I made this program in high school when classes were online to automate filling out the attendance surveys that our teachers were making us do.
Originally the program also opened up the zoom calls for each class, but I made the code so spagettilly that when the quarter ended I didn't feel like redoing that part of it and just deleted the part to open the zoom calls.
Even though I had this program I did still participate in most of my classes, this script was mostly so that I wouldn't forget to fill the attendance surveys.
